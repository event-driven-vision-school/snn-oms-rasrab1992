## Introduction

The brain processes information through electrical impulses 
called **spikes** or **action potentials**. 
Unlike conventional artificial neurons that 
pass continuous-valued activations, biological neurons 
communicate through discrete, all-or-nothing events, and the 
timing of those events carries meaning.

Understanding how a single neuron integrates input, 
reaches threshold, fires, and resets is the foundation 
of everything in neuromorphic computing: from spiking neural 
networks to event-based vision to brain-inspired robotics.



This tutorial series starts from the simplest biologically 
plausible neuron model and progressively introduces biological constraints, 
such as the **refractory period**, that shape real neural dynamics, 
before scaling up to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and a full biologically 
inspired **Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS)** SNN model.

## Tutorial 1A — The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron

**Script:** [`Tutorial1-LIFNeuron.py`](Tutorial1-LIFneuron.py)


This tutorial simulates a **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** neuron, the most
widely used model in computational neuroscience. 
The membrane potential is computed numerically and visualised 
in response to a series of external input current pulses.

> 💡 **Key concept:** The LIF model captures the essential 
> dynamics of biological neurons: integrate incoming charge, 
> leak over time, fire when a threshold is reached, then reset. 
> It is computationally simple yet biologically meaningful.

The governing equation is:

```
dV/dt = (-(V - V_rest) + R·I(t)) / τ_m

If V ≥ V_threshold  →  spike emitted, V reset to V_rest
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Symbol | Typical Value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Membrane capacitance | `Cm` | 0.74 | Capacity to store charge |
| Leak conductance | `gL` | 0.1 | Rate of passive voltage decay |
| Resting potential | `VL` | −65 mV | Equilibrium in absence of input |
| Threshold | `VT` | −50 mV | Voltage at which a spike is emitted |
| Reset potential | `VR` | −67 mV | Voltage after spike |
| Membrane time constant | `τ_m` | `Cm / gL` | Timescale of integration and leak |


### Exercises

**Task 1 — Explore LIF parameters**

Modify the LIF parameters `Cm`, `gL`, or `VT` and observe how the membrane potential and spiking behaviour change in the animation. What happens when you increase or decrease each value independently?

**Task 2 — Find the minimum firing current**

Now consider the pulse current $I_{ext_{amp}}$. Find the minimal current $I_{ext_{amp}}$ which causes the neuron to fire at least once.

> **Hint:** Increase $I_{ext_{amp}}$ until the neuron fires.

```python
I_min = None
if I_min is not None:
    print(f"Minimum input current required to reach threshold: {I_min:.2f} uA")
```

### Questions

1. What is the minimal pulse current $I_{ext_{amp}}$ which causes the neuron to fire at least once?
2. How does changing the amplitude and duration of the input current pulses (`pulse_duration`) affect the firing behaviour? Try halving and doubling both values.
3. What happens when you modify `Cm`, `gL`, or `VT`? For each parameter, predict the effect before running the simulation, then verify.

## Tutorial 2 — The LIF Neuron with Refractory Period

**Script:** [`Tutorial2-NeuronRefractory.py`](Tutorial2-NeuronRefractory.py)

This tutorial extends the LIF model by introducing 
the **refractory period**, the brief interval after a 
spike during which a neuron cannot fire again, regardless of input. 
This is a fundamental biological constraint that shapes neural 
coding and network dynamics.

> **Key concept:** After a spike, 
> biological neurons enter a refractory
> state due to ion channel dynamics. 
> During the **absolute refractory period**, 
> no spike is possible. This limits the maximum 
> firing rate and plays a crucial role in temporal coding.

### Exercises

**Task 1 — Observe the refractory period**

Run the script and compare the membrane potential and spike trains of the neuron with and without refractory period (`t_ref = 2.0 ms`). What do you notice about the firing rate?

**Task 2 — Explore the firing rate vs. input current**

Adapt the code to feed the neuron a constant external current $I_{ext}$. Use 10 equidistant values from $[I_{min}, 18]\ \mu A$, where $I_{min}$ is your result from Tutorial 1. For each current value, compute the firing rate (spikes/sec) for both scenarios and plot them against $I_{ext}$.

> **Hint:** Wrap the simulation in a `for` loop over `I_values = np.linspace(I_min, 18, 10)`. To simulate with constant current, replace the pulsed `I_ext` with `np.full_like(time, I_ext_amp)`. Then reuse the simulation loop from Task 1 twice, once without refractory and once with, and count the spikes for each run. Divide the spike count by `T / 1000` to get the firing rate in spikes/sec.


```python
# TODO: set I_min from your result in Tutorial 1
I_min = None

# TODO: define 10 equidistant current values from I_min to 18
I_values = None  # np.linspace(I_min, 18, 10)

# TODO: for each current value simulate with and without refractory period
#       and compute firing rate (spikes/sec) for both cases
firing_rate = None
firing_rate_r = None

print(f"Difference in firing rates: {firing_rate[-1] - firing_rate_r[-1]} spikes/sec at I_ext = 18 uA.")
```

### Questions

1. What is the difference in spike rate with and without refractory period for $I_{ext} = 18\ \mu A$?
2. How does increasing the refractory period duration $\tau_{ref}$ affect the maximum achievable firing rate?
3. Can you find a current value where the refractory period prevents additional spikes that would otherwise occur?

## Tutorial 3A — Spiking Neural Networks (Brian2)

**Script:** [`Tutorial3A-SNN.py`](Tutorial3A-SNN.py)

This tutorial introduces **network-level** spiking dynamics using the **Brian2** simulator. A population of 100 independent LIF neurons is simulated, each with a different baseline membrane potential, and their spiking activity and firing rates are visualised.

> **Key concept:** Some biological neurons fire spontaneously without external input — for example, brainstem neurons that drive breathing. This intrinsic excitability is modelled via the baseline membrane potential `v0`: the higher it is, the more often the neuron fires on its own.

### Exercise

**Task 1 — Observe spontaneous activity**

Run the simulation and observe at which times each neuron fires and how the baseline potential controls the firing rate.

Then adjust the `tau` parameter and observe how the activity changes for:

```python
tau = 2.0 * ms
tau = 10.0 * ms
tau = 50.0 * ms
```

### Questions

1. Which neurons fire most frequently and why?
2. How does increasing `tau` affect the firing rate across the population?
3. What is the relationship between `v0` and firing rate, is it linear?

## Tutorial 3B — Spiking Neural Networks (Brian2)

**Script:** [`Tutorial3B-SNN.py`](Tutorial3B-SNN.py)

This tutorial introduces **network-level** spiking dynamics using the **Brian2** simulator. A chain of 10 LIF neurons is connected via synapses, and signal propagation is visualised in real time. Only one neuron fires spontaneously — the rest respond only through synaptic input.

> **Key concept:** Real neural computation emerges at the *network* level. This tutorial demonstrates how a spike initiated by a single neuron propagates through a chain, and how synaptic strength, connection direction, and refractory period all shape that propagation.

### Exercises

**Task 1 — Observe signal propagation**

Run the script and observe how the spike initiated by the middle neuron spreads in both directions along the chain. Play with the `tau` parameter and observe how it influences the system.

Then:
- Set `tau = 10 * ms`
- Disable right-to-left connections by removing `S.connect(condition='j == i-1 and i > 0')`
- Move the non-zero baseline potential to the **first neuron** instead of the middle one

How far does the signal travel? Which is the most distant neuron to spike?

**Task 2 — Explore connection strength**

With the unidirectional chain from Task 1, explore weight values in the range $[0.9, 1.1]$. How does spiking behaviour change?

**Task 3 — Explore the refractory period**

Set weights back to `w = 1.0` and decrease the refractory period from `5 * ms` down to `1 * ms`. How far does the signal spread for `1 * ms`?

### Questions

1. How far does the signal travel when connections are unidirectional and the first neuron drives the chain?
2. What happens to signal propagation when `w < 1.0`? And when `w > 1.0`?
3. How far does the signal spread with a refractory period of `1 * ms`?

## Tutorial 4 — Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS)

**Script:** [`Tutorial4-OMS.py`](Tutorial4-OMS.py)

This tutorial implements an **Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS)** network,
a biologically inspired mechanism for motion segmentation directly
derived from the research of the NPC Lab.
The system analyses event-based frames using
centre-surround spatial kernels to detect local motion differences,
producing a segmentation map comparable with ground-truth masks.

> **Key concept:** OMS cells are modelled on retinal
> amacrine cells that respond selectively to
> objects moving differently from their static background.
>
> This work is directly connected to [D'Angelo et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1088/2634-4386/addc90).

**Download data:** [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/g5j17yh6elrc61s66aiba/AO2lSvWa5oLlZYhc0V2CNkw?rlkey=w0hgpsbd2mjvbfp4vrtdm5bhe&st=hi09k9to&dl=0)

Place the data in `data/evimo/` before running the script.

### Exercises

**Task 1 — Explore the OMS threshold**

Run the script and observe the three panels: the input event frame, the ground-truth segmentation mask, and the OMS output. Then vary the `threshold` parameter in `OMS_PARAMS` and observe how the segmentation changes:

```python
OMS_PARAMS = {
    ...
    'threshold': 0.86,  # try values between 0.5 and 1.0
    ...
}
```

What happens when the threshold is very low? What happens when it is very high?

**Task 2 — Compute the OMS motion score**

For a randomly selected frame, compute the percentage of pixels classified as motion by the OMS network:

```python
frame_idx = np.random.randint(len(evframesdata))
threshold = config.OMS_PARAMS['threshold']

# TODO: compute the OMS output for the selected frame
# TODO: compute the percentage of motion pixels (OMS == 255)
motion_ratio = None

print(f"Frame index: {frame_idx}")
print(f"Motion ratio (%): {motion_ratio:.2f}")
```

**Task 3 — Explore OMS parameters**

Vary the parameters in `OMS_PARAMS` (kernel sizes, sigma values) and observe how segmentation quality changes. Which parameters have the most impact?

### Questions

1. How does the difference between centre and surround responses contribute to motion segmentation?
2. How does the choice of `threshold` affect the OMS output — what happens at very low or very high values?
3. Which `OMS_PARAMS` have the most impact on segmentation quality and why?

## Bonus — Live Demo: OMS on Neuromorphic Hardware

<p align="center">

For a live demonstration of the OMS pipeline deployed on the
**SynSense Speck2f** neuromorphic chip, see the companion repository:

[github.com/GiuliaDAngelo/Speckegomotion](https://github.com/GiuliaDAngelo/Speckegomotion)

This demo is directly connected to [D'Angelo et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1088/2634-4386/addc90) and shows the full OMS, visual attention and control pipeline running in real time on neuromorphic hardware with event-based eye movements under two conditions:

- **Microsaccades** — small continuous jitter movements around a fixed position, producing a steady stream of events even in a static scene
- **Saccades** — large ballistic jumps to random positions, alternating between dense event bursts and complete silence

The two conditions reveal how eye movement strategy shapes the output of the OMS network on-chip.
